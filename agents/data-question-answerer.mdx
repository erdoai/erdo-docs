# Data Question Answerer Agent

The Data Question Answerer Agent interprets natural language questions about data and automatically generates appropriate analyses to provide accurate answers. It bridges the gap between business questions and technical data analysis.

## Quick Start

```python
from erdo.actions import bot

# Ask a question about data
result = bot.invoke(
    bot_name="data question answerer",
    parameters={
        "question": "What were our top-selling products last quarter?",
        "datasets": ["sales_data.csv", "product_catalog.xlsx"]
    }
)
```

        "datasets": ["sales_data.csv"]
    }
)

# Follow-up question (uses context)
follow_up = bot.invoke(

        "context_id": first_result.context_id
    }

## Question Optimization

### Best Practices for Questions

- **Be Specific**: "Sales in Q4 2024" vs "recent sales"
- **Include Context**: Mention relevant time periods, regions, or segments
- **Use Business Terms**: The agent understands domain-specific terminology
- **Ask Follow-ups**: Build on previous answers for deeper insights

### Example Optimized Questions

```python
# Good: Specific and contextual
"What was the month-over-month growth rate for premium subscription revenue in Q4 2024?"

# Better: Includes comparison and constraints
"Compare premium vs basic subscription revenue growth for Q4 2024, excluding promotional periods"

# Best: Actionable with business context
"Which customer segments show declining engagement this quarter, and what actions should we prioritize?"
```
