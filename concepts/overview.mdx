# Core Concepts Overview

Erdo is built around a few key concepts that work together to create powerful AI automation workflows. Understanding these concepts will help you build effective agents and leverage the full potential of the platform.

### 1. Agents

**Agents** are the top-level containers that define complete workflows. They:

- Orchestrate multiple steps
- Define execution order and dependencies
- Handle errors and retries
- Manage resources and permissions

### 2. Steps

**Steps** are the individual actions within an agent. Each step:

- Performs one specific operation
- Can depend on previous steps
- Has configurable execution conditions
- Produces outputs for subsequent steps

### 3. Actions

**Actions** define what each step actually does:

- **LLM Actions**: Generate text, analyze content, make decisions
- **Code Execution**: Run Python code for data processing
- **Memory Actions**: Store and retrieve knowledge
- **Web Research**: Search and parse web content
- **Utility Actions**: Data transformation and flow control

### 4. Result Handlers

**Result Handlers** add conditional logic to your workflows:

- **Conditional Execution**: Run different steps based on outcomes
- **Error Recovery**: Handle failures and implement retry logic
- **Dynamic Routing**: Branch workflows based on data or results
- **Success Actions**: Execute follow-up steps when conditions are met

### 5. Tools & Integrations

**Tools** extend agent capabilities:

- Web search and content parsing
- API integrations
- Database connections
- File processing
- Custom functions

## Common Workflow Patterns

### Data Analysis Pipeline

```
Input Data → Validation → Processing → Analysis → Insights → Storage
```

### Research Automation

```
Query → Web Search → Content Analysis → Synthesis → Report Generation
```

### Business Process Automation

```
Trigger Event → Data Collection → Decision Logic → Action Execution → Notification
```

### Content Processing

```
Raw Content → Classification → Extraction → Transformation → Distribution
```

## Best Practices

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Design Principles">
    - **Single Responsibility**: Each agent should have one clear purpose -
    **Modular Steps**: Break complex logic into smaller, reusable steps -
    **Error Handling**: Always plan for failure scenarios - **Documentation**:
    Clearly document agent purpose and usage
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Performance">
    - **Parallel Execution**: Use parallel steps where possible - **Resource
    Management**: Set appropriate limits and timeouts - **Caching**: Cache
    expensive operations and API calls - **Monitoring**: Track performance and
    optimization opportunities
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Security">
    - **Input Validation**: Always validate external inputs - **Access
    Control**: Use appropriate visibility settings - **Credential Management**:
    Use secure storage for API keys - **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate
    constraints and timeouts
