# Welcome to Erdo

Erdo is the deployment platform for AI agents. Write agents in Python, deploy with one command. We handle state persistence, monitoring, and scaling so you can focus on building.

## Why Choose Erdo?

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="From Code to Production in One Command">
  No Docker, no Kubernetes, no infrastructure. Just `erdo sync` and your agent is live with a production URL.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Persistent State Management">
  Your agents maintain state across deployments and restarts. Built-in retry
  handling for failed steps and recovery from interruptions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Production Infrastructure Built In">
  Monitoring, logging, event streaming, parallel execution, and resource
  management. Everything you need to run agents at scale.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Git-Based Workflow">
  Connect your repo. Push to deploy. Automatic rollbacks, preview branches, and zero-downtime updates.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How Erdo Works

1. **Write your agent** using our Python SDK
2. **Test locally** with `erdo run`
3. **Deploy to production** with `erdo sync`
4. **Monitor and iterate** through our dashboard

Your agent automatically gets:

- **Production URL** - `https://your-agent.erdo.ai`
- **Persistent state** - Survives restarts and redeploys
- **Automatic retries** - Failed steps retry intelligently
- **Real-time monitoring** - Logs, metrics, and debugging
- **API & UI access** - REST API and chat interface
