## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through creating your first AI agent with Erdo. By the end, you'll have a working agent that can automate tasks and integrate with external services.

<Info>
  **Prerequisites** You should have Python 3.8+ and access to the Erdo platform
  ([sign up here](https://erdo.ai))
</Info>

## Step 1: Install the Erdo CLI

The fastest way to get started is with the Erdo CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Homebrew (Recommended)
brew install erdoai/tap/erdo
```

```bash Manual Download
# Download from GitHub Releases
curl -L https://github.com/erdoai/erdo-cli/releases/latest/download/erdo-darwin-amd64 -o erdo
chmod +x erdo
mv erdo /usr/local/bin/
```

</CodeGroup>

Verify the installation:

```bash
erdo --version
```

## Step 2: Authenticate

Connect the CLI to your Erdo account:

```bash
erdo login
```

This will open your browser to authenticate with your Erdo account.

## Step 3: Create Your First Agent

Let's create a simple task automation agent:

```bash
erdo init my-first-agent
cd my-first-agent
```

This creates a new agent project with the basic structure.

## Step 4: Understanding Agent Structure

Erdo agents are built with these key components:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agents - The Main Orchestrator">
    ```python
    from erdo import Agent

    agent = Agent(
        name="task_automator",
        description="Automates tasks and integrates with external services",
        visibility="public"
    )
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Steps - Individual Actions">
    ```python
    from erdo import Step
    from erdo.actions import llm

    automation_step = Step(
        agent=agent,
        key="automate",
        actiontype=llm.message(
            model="claude-sonnet-4",
            query="Help automate this task: {{task_description}}"
        )
    )
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Actions - The Building Blocks">
    ```python
    from erdo.actions import llm, memory, codeexec, websearch

    # Language model actions
    llm_action = llm.message(model="claude-sonnet-4", query="{{query}}")

    # Memory operations
    memory_action = memory.search(query="{{search_term}}", limit=5)

    # Code execution
    code_action = codeexec.execute(code="print('Hello!')")

    # Web search
    search_action = websearch.search(query="{{topic}} research")
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tools - External Capabilities">
    ```python
    from erdo import Tool

    web_search_tool = Tool(
        name="search_web",
        description="Search for information online",
        actiontype="websearch.search",
        parameters={"query": "{{query}}"}
    )
    ```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 5: Test Locally

Before deploying to production, test your agent locally:

```bash
# Run your agent locally for testing
erdo run --input "Automate my email responses"

# Validate your agent configuration
erdo validate
```

## Step 6: Deploy to Production

Once you're satisfied with your local testing, deploy to production:

```bash
# Deploy your agent to production
erdo sync

# Your agent is now live at: https://my-first-agent.erdo.ai
```

Your agent will automatically get:

- A production URL
- Persistent state across deployments
- Built-in monitoring and logging
- API and web interface access

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication issues">
    Make sure you're logged in: `erdo login`

    Check your authentication status: `erdo whoami`

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent not deploying">
    Verify your agent configuration with: `erdo validate`

    Check logs with: `erdo logs --agent my-first-agent`

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="CLI command not found">
    Make sure the CLI is in your PATH or try installing via Homebrew:
    ```bash
    brew install erdoai/tap/erdo
